# Project Roadmap (v2)

This document outlines upcoming development sprints and how we prioritize issues.

## Priority Labels

- **P0** – Must fix immediately for release stability or security.
- **P1** – Important enhancements that should land in the next sprint.
- **P2** – Nice-to-have improvements scheduled as time permits.

## Planned Sprints

| Sprint | Focus | Example Items |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Sprint 1** | Core server polish | Bug fixes, improved tests, deployment automation |
| **Sprint 2** | Extended toolset | Additional dataset loaders, more expectation helpers |
| **Sprint 3** | Ecosystem integration | Docker optimizations, example workflows |

These plans are high level and may change as the project evolves.
