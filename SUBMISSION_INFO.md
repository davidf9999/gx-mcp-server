## One-Liner Description

Exposes Great Expectations data-quality checks as MCP tools for LLM agents.

## Short Description (Paragraph)

`gx-mcp-server` is an open-source server that bridges the gap between Large Language Model (LLM) agents and robust data quality. It exposes core Great Expectations functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing any MCP-compatible agent to programmatically load datasets, define data quality rules (Expectations), and run validation checks to make more reliable, data-aware decisions.
